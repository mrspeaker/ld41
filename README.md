two games overlaayed on each other.
minecraft in background, pitfall II in foreground


Foreground is pitfall 2 - explore caverns, avoid obstacles, get gold etc.

Background is mineraft zombie shooter. collect health/food/resources that you can use in the foreground game.

If you get near a zombie in minecraft, it emerges from the ground (like how skeletons appear in Ghost n Goblins).

Issue: platformer is moving left and right primarily. Minecraft is forward and backward. This encourages/requires player to be strafing a lot. Need to make this a feature of the background game.

Would be great if geographical/weather features appeared in both games at the same time.

Maybe: pickups in foreground that teleport you in background.

Hard parts:
  * too long to make/integrate animated 3d models. Need to figure out billboard sprites for background.
  * Making terrain that is lets player concetrate on foreground for long enough
  * proc-gen the foregraound map?
